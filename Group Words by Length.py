'''
Group Words by Length

You are designing a vocabulary training module for a language learning platform. 
Users input a list of words, and the system must group them by word length while preserving their original order.
This supports level-based exercisesâ€”shorter words for beginners and longer ones for advanced learners.

To implement this feature, you are required to write a Python function named group_words_by_length(words)
that takes a list of words as input. 
The function should return a dictionary where the keys are the word lengths, 
and the values are lists containing all the words of that length. 
The relative order of words within each group must match their order of appearance in the original list. 
If the input list is empty, the function should return an empty dictionary.
